            <p style="font-weight:800">Why Limelight?</p>
            <p>Almost 1 year ago, I started itching to make music. For a casual hobby, I found the buyin was relatively steep - a good microphone can range hundreds, and so can a DAW</p>
            <p>There is an integration requirement too - for the longest time my friends and I were carrying around either paper note-pads or random text-widgets on your phone</p>
            <p>I built Limelight to ease the Rap buy-in for amateur musicians</p>
            <p>I also believe that music relates human unlike any other medium, and I wanted to offer the framework for a community for my app users</p>

            <p>Is it free?</p>
            <p>A - Mostly. Servers have overhead that scales commensurate to the size of the userbase. My goal is to make this as affordable as possible, while still offering quality features</p>
