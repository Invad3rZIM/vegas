Code I wrote on Vacation.

This is actually just a namespace that holds 2 Miniprojects that are still in the works...

1. HTML landing page for my app that will one day be published.
- This has been handed off to Sister Zim to one day Finish for me.
2. Syllable Analyzer Engine written in Golang
- Downloaded Dictionary of 143k words and their phonetic syllable mapping; Construct Node Tree To Optimize Lookup Data on Each word and find rhymes that fit regex-like engine (W.I.P.)
